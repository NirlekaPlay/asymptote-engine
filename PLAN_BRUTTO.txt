1. Inventory System and Gun System
 a. Items. Items have atleast these basic functionalities:
      i. They can be dropped;
     ii. They can be picked up and kept; and
    iii. And can be used.
 b. Guns. Guns must have the functionalities of items, and also the following:
      i. They can shoot, reload, aim, and takedown other living entities.

So I'm thingking of this, we need a declarative and data driven item and inventory
system, easy to create items, and not be a fucked up mess like other Roblox tools / items.
It can also be seamlessly used by other living entities besides players.

Item class

onDropped: When its dropped
onPickedUp: When its picked up by a living entity
updateInventory: Calls every frame while inside the entity's inventory

And other things idk

The thing is, we should atleast define the client and server logic to one module
so im thingking we pass something like an ItemContext, and provide methods like
:isClient() and :isServer() then :getClientContext() and :getServerContext()

but even with that idk how to deal with viewmodels, etc.
