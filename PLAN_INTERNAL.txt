Project Asymptote Engine Internal Design Document

    This document will outline the low-level implementation
    of defined systems in PLAN.txt of the engine's repository's
    root directory.

1. Entities. (a) Definition. An Entity is defined as any dynamic,
interactive object within the game world that is not part of the static
environment such as buildings, structural elements, or immobile props.
Entities includes all objects that possess runtime behavior, mobility,
or state changes independent of the terrain or architecture.

This includes, but not limited to:
     i. Non-Player Characters (NPCs);
    ii. Armed or unarmed explosives (e.g., placed C4s);
   iii. Dead bodies or corpses; and
    iv. Dropped or throwable items

However, entities do not include interactive static elements such as doors,
breaker boxes, or any object that is fixed to the environment and lacks
independent simulation logic.

 (b) Implementation. The sole purpose of this entire system is to improve
the AI detection. Instead of detecting Players, it can detect dead bodies,
other NPCs being held hostage, dropped weapons, placed C4s, etc.
