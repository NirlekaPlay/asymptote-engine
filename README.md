# Asymptote Engine
*An extremely overengineered mess of a development framework for creating
stealth games on Roblox, based on [Entry Point](https://www.roblox.com/games/740581508/Entry-Point), and its successor, [Operators](https://www.roblox.com/games/740581795/Operators-Demo),
both made by Cishshato.*

### Why did I name it Asymptote Engine?
Well, it means a lot of things depending on what state of sanity of me you're currently asking to.

 * In mathematics, an ***asymptote*** is a line or curve that a given curve approaches, but never actually touches or intersects. Which is kinda like the detection mechanics of this game! You must keep that goddamn detection value from hitting 1 so the NPC won't detect you.
 * However, if I'm going insane while working on this piece of shrimp of a framework, I just complain about that one time during development the detection value slowly reaching towards 1, but NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO 1.

### Roblox Asymptote Engine Demo
You can currently play the game yourself on Roblox [here.](https://www.roblox.com/games/111847508391227/Asymptote-Engine-Demo.)

#### Joining Experimental Server
We have an inside joke of the Experimental version of the game being more stable than the actual Stable version. To join Experimental version, just like in *Operators*, hold down the engine version text for more than 3 seconds and you should see the "Join Testing Server" button.
