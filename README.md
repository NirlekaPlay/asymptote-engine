# Asymptote Engine
An extreemly overengineered mess of a development framework for creating
stealth games on Roblox, based on Entry Point, and its successor, Operators,
both made by Cishshato.

Why do I named it Asymptote Engine? Well it means
a lot of things depending on what state of sanity
of me you're currently asking to.

 * In mathematics, an asymptote is a line or curve that a given curve approaches but never actually touches or intersects. Which kinda like the detection mechanics of this game! You must keep that goddamn detection value from hitting 1 so the NPC won't detect you.
 * However, if I'm going insane while working on this piece of shrimp of a framework, I just complain about that one time during development the detection value slowly reaching towards 1 but NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO 1.
